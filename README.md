# EDA-And-Model-Comparison-On-IRIS-Dataset

Components of the project:

- Performance of EDA on the iris dataset and creation of DecisionTreeClassifier and KNN models.
- Use of GridSearchCV to find optimal hyperparameters for each model
- Comparison of the performance of both models using an AUC-ROCcurve.
